# APCP Central Agent Handoffs

Cross-agent handoff register. A handoff transfers context, not authority.

## Required fields

### <HANDOFF-ID> — <YYYY-MM-DD>
- **From:** <agent id / session id>
- **To:** <agent id>
- **Reason:** <why another role is needed>
- **Repository state:** <commit/ref>
- **Work completed:** <summary>
- **Remaining work:** <exact task>
- **Evidence/records:** <paths, issue/event ids>
- **Authorization:** <existing authorization reference or "not authorized; proposal only">
- **Stop condition:** <when receiving agent must stop>
- **Status:** <OPEN | ACCEPTED | COMPLETE | SUPERSEDED>

## Rules

- Never invent authority through a handoff.
- The receiving agent must independently recover current authorization.
- A handoff can be accepted while the sending agent continues unrelated independent work.
- Close or supersede stale handoffs when state changes materially.
