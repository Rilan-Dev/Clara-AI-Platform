# NEXT_ACTION.md — Fresh-Session Continuation Instruction

> Canonical continuation instruction. Snapshot: **2026-10-05 — Integrations I-1 contract foundation implemented; verification and architect review pending.** GitHub repository state is authoritative.

## Read this first

Read, in order:
1. `docs/project-control/PROJECT_STATE.md`
2. `docs/project-control/CURRENT_PHASE.md`
3. `docs/project-control/VERIFICATION_STATE.md` — current Integrations I-1 record
4. `docs/project-control/ISSUES.md`
5. `docs/project-control/DECISIONS.md` — D-031
6. `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-05-clara-integrations-framework.md`
7. `docs/project-control/sessions/SESSION-033.md`

## Active work

**Integrations Framework — I-1: host-neutral contract/test foundation.**

D-031 authorizes only:
- `src/modules/ai-platform-core/integrations/**` contract/type definitions, pure validation helpers, tests, and exports;
- threat-model/test-boundary work necessary to validate the contract.

Forbidden until separately authorized:
- database/schema/migrations;
- OAuth routes/token exchange;
- credential-vault implementation;
- Activepieces runtime/dependencies;
- outbound HTTP/egress execution;
- integration tool execution;
- deployment;
- changes to D-023 billing semantics.

## Current checkpoint

- Implementation foundation exists.
- A contract hardening correction was applied after architect review: generic connection metadata and generic error-details bags were removed from the reusable boundary; connection-store/credential-vault APIs now identify concrete connection IDs.
- Focused I-1 CI verification has been added for Vitest, strict TypeScript, and ESLint.
- **Verification is still PENDING** because no GitHub Actions run is currently exposed through the connected GitHub integration for the feature head.
- No PASS is claimed for I-1.
- I-2 and all later integration work remain unauthorized.

## Next bounded action

1. Obtain executable I-1 verification from the repository's CI/Actions surface.
2. Re-run the focused contract tests, strict typecheck, and lint.
3. Re-check immutable-source integrity, runtime import boundary, secret scan, and scope.
4. Perform the architect Gate-D review of the exact verified commit.
5. If all required gates pass, record I-1 closure and issue the next explicit authorization boundary. Otherwise record the blocking finding and correct only within D-031 scope.

**Stopping boundary:** do not implement I-2, OAuth, persistence, credential storage, egress execution, integration actions, or deployment until ChatGPT explicitly authorizes the next bounded sub-phase.
