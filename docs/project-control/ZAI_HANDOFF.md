# ZAI_HANDOFF.md — Z.AI Developer Handoff System

> Canonical developer-handoff protocol and active handoff instance for the Clara project-control system.
> **Part I** is the durable, reusable handoff protocol — it applies to every implementation phase and changes only by architect direction.
> **Part II** holds the **active handoff instance**: the current phase's assignment materialized in the authoritative format. When the architect issues a new phase handoff, the developer replaces Part II with the new instance; superseded instances remain recoverable in Git history (and, from Phase 4 onward, in the canonical worklog).
> Snapshot date: **2026-10-05**. The historical Part II Z.AI closure/STOP record remains preserved; ChatGPT is the active implementation owner under D-024 and Phase 7-C is now closed by architect PASS. Repository state is authoritative — refresh it before acting (§I.6).
> Canonical blank form: `docs/project-control/templates/PHASE_HANDOFF_TEMPLATE.md` — the only handoff template; no duplicate handoff formats may be created.

## Part I — Handoff Protocol (durable; applies to every phase)

### I.1 Purpose

Establish one authoritative, reusable format for Z.AI implementation handoffs so that every implementation phase is **explicit, bounded, reproducible, reviewable, and stoppable**, and so that a completely fresh Z.AI session can implement any approved phase **from repository state alone** — without access to any previous conversation. The handoff system is durable repository state (DECISIONS.md D-006), not chat-carried instruction.

### I.2 Roles and authority boundaries

| Role | Holder | Boundaries |
|---|---|---|
| Developer / implementer | **Z.AI** | Executes the active handoff only. Implements, self-verifies, records evidence, commits, pushes, reports, and **STOPs at the phase boundary**. Must never claim architect approval, never close a phase, never assume architect authority, and never start a later phase without a new architect-issued handoff |
| Architect / technical lead / reviewer / controller | **ChatGPT** | Issues handoffs, reviews evidence, records review outcomes, closes phases, controls Vercel/Supabase operations where applicable. Only ChatGPT/project-owner review closes a phase (D-009) |
| Deployment authority | Vercel (controlled by ChatGPT) | Z.AI never deploys unless explicitly authorized in a handoff (D-004) |
| Database authority | Supabase (controlled by ChatGPT) | Z.AI never changes remote database state unless explicitly authorized in a handoff (D-005) |

### I.3 Required handoff structure (mandatory sections)

Every handoff instance — Part II of this file, created from `docs/project-control/templates/PHASE_HANDOFF_TEMPLATE.md` — MUST contain all of the following sections. A handoff missing any section is incomplete and must not be executed.

| # | Section | Must contain |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Phase identity | Phase number; phase name; current status; repository; branch; baseline commit; architect; developer; handoff date |
| 2 | Objective | Exactly what the developer is being asked to accomplish — one precise statement, no implied extras |
| 3 | Scope | Explicit list of what may be changed (files, areas, documents) |
| 4 | Non-scope | Explicit list of what must NOT be changed — including later phases, product code, database, deployment, and immutable sources as applicable |
| 5 | Prerequisites | Documents, commits, decisions, dependencies, or environmental requirements that must already exist before implementation |
| 6 | Required reading | Exact repository documents the developer must read before implementation |
| 7 | Implementation tasks | Numbered, deterministic tasks in execution order |
| 8 | Files / components | Expected files or bounded areas that may be changed. Where implementation legitimately needs discovery, the permitted architectural area is defined instead of exact files |
| 9 | Interfaces / contracts | API, module, data, tool, adapter, or document contracts that must remain compatible |
| 10 | Security constraints | No secrets; no credentials; no tokens; tenancy boundaries; authorization requirements; immutable-source boundaries; production-branch restrictions — as applicable |
| 11 | Testing requirements | Required tests; validation commands; expected evidence; what must be tested before completion |
| 12 | Acceptance criteria | Concrete pass/fail conditions |
| 13 | Git requirements | Permitted branch; commit requirements; push requirements; no unrelated changes; no production-branch work |
| 14 | Evidence requirements | The developer completion report fields (§I.7) |
| 15 | Review boundary | The statements in §I.8 |
| 16 | STOP boundary | The hard stop defined in §I.9 |

### I.4 Phase lifecycle and status vocabulary

Canonical statuses (D-011; identical vocabulary across all control documents):

```
PLANNED → IN_PROGRESS → developer completion → VERIFIED (architect review) → CLOSED
                        ↘ CORRECTION_REQUIRED (architect review found a defect) → corrective handoff → correction → re-review
                        ↘ BLOCKED (state values disagree, or the phase cannot safely proceed) → reconcile → resume
```

Rules:

1. `PLANNED` — phase defined but not started. Assignment received but not yet begun keeps the phase `PLANNED` until implementation starts.
2. `IN_PROGRESS` — active work underway. **Developer implementation complete, awaiting architect review, is still `IN_PROGRESS`.**
3. Developer completion NEVER transitions a phase to `VERIFIED` or `CLOSED`. Only architect review records `VERIFIED`, and only a `PASS` review outcome closes a phase (`CLOSED`). `PASS_WITH_FOLLOWUP` keeps the phase open with recorded follow-ups.
4. `CORRECTION_REQUIRED` — architect review found a defect; §I.5 applies.
5. `BLOCKED` — the Final State Contract values disagree across control documents, or a blocker prevents safe progress. The phase stays `BLOCKED` until reconciled; reconciliation is recorded in `VERIFICATION_STATE.md`.
6. Phase status is recorded in `PROJECT_STATE.md`, `CURRENT_PHASE.md`, `NEXT_ACTION.md`, `ZAI_HANDOFF.md` (Part II Phase identity), and `VERIFICATION_STATE.md` — these must always agree (Final State Contract).

### I.5 Correction protocol (`CORRECTION_REQUIRED`)

When architect review returns `CORRECTION_REQUIRED`, the architect issues a **corrective handoff** to the developer. The corrective handoff contains, at minimum:

1. **Finding** — the exact defect or divergence found in review;
2. **Affected scope** — the files/documents/areas touched by the defect;
3. **Required correction** — precisely what must change;
4. **Acceptance criteria** — concrete pass/fail conditions for the correction;
5. **Verification requirements** — commands/evidence required to demonstrate the correction;
6. **Explicit non-scope** — what the correction must NOT touch;
7. **Stop condition** — where the developer stops after delivering the correction.

Rules:

- The developer executes **only** the corrective scope. The developer must NOT independently broaden the correction, fix unrelated issues, refactor, or ride along any extra change.
- The correction is delivered as a focused commit whose message and evidence reference the finding (traceability: finding → corrective handoff → developer commit → re-review, per plan §Review Focus #5).
- Re-review follows the normal review boundary (§I.8). Only `PASS` closes the phase.
- Observed exemplar: the Phase 0 correction cycle (architect finding → corrective directive → developer commit `bcc1769d` → architect advancement; ISSUES.md I-002).
- **From Phase 6 onward** the canonical correction-handoff form is `docs/project-control/templates/CORRECTION_HANDOFF_TEMPLATE.md` (established by Phase 6 — Correction and Issue-Control Workflow, 2026-10-01; the durable workflow contract is `VERIFICATION_STATE.md` §"Correction and issue-control workflow"; the issue schema/lifecycle/severity model is `ISSUES.md` §"Issue-control system"). A corrective handoff instance is materialized from that template into Part II of this file (annotating or replacing the active instance per §I.12), referencing the related `ISSUES.md` issue ID; the issue's lifecycle status and the correction's status are kept consistent per the issue/phase status relationship (`ISSUES.md` §4). The pre-Phase-6 corrective cycles (Phases 0, 4, and 5) stand as recorded under the convention then in force.

### I.6 Handoff integrity (staleness protection)

Every handoff instance must identify: **repository, branch, baseline commit, phase, date, current status** (Part II Phase identity). GitHub is authoritative (D-001); chat history is supplementary.

Before implementing any handoff, Z.AI MUST refresh repository state and verify the handoff is current:

```bash
git fetch --prune origin
git status --porcelain=v1                 # must be clean
git branch --show-current                  # must equal the handoff's branch
git rev-parse HEAD                         # must equal the handoff's baseline commit, or a documented descendant of it
git rev-parse origin/<branch>              # local HEAD must not be behind origin
```

If the baseline has changed materially — unexpected commits on the branch, divergence from origin, phase-state disagreement among the control documents, or a control-document record of a different active phase — Z.AI MUST STOP and request/await a refreshed handoff rather than blindly applying stale instructions. A stale handoff executed against a moved baseline is exactly the drift failure the control system exists to prevent (RISKS.md R-1; ISSUES.md I-002, I-004).

### I.7 Developer evidence and completion report

At completion of the assigned scope, Z.AI reports ALL of the following (mirrors plan §Required Z.AI Evidence Format):

- exact changed files;
- implementation summary (what was created/changed);
- tests run;
- validation commands and their outputs/results;
- Git status (clean/in-sync) and the implementation commit SHA;
- remaining issues;
- remaining risks;
- deviations from scope (if any);
- unresolved questions (if any);
- security/tenancy considerations (if applicable);
- migration/deployment details (only if applicable);
- explicit confirmation that no later phase was started.

The report is developer-reported evidence, submitted for architect review. Z.AI must not claim architect approval.

### I.8 Review boundary

**Developer completion does not equal phase completion.**

**Only ChatGPT/project-owner architect review can close the phase.**

Review outcomes are `PASS` (closes the phase), `PASS_WITH_FOLLOWUP` (phase stays open with recorded follow-ups), and `CORRECTION_REQUIRED` (corrective handoff issued; §I.5). Review outcomes and their evidence are recorded by the architect workflow in `VERIFICATION_STATE.md`, which strictly separates developer-reported from architect-verified evidence (D-012).

### I.9 STOP boundary (hard stop)

After completing the assigned scope, validation, commit/push, and the evidence report, Z.AI MUST STOP and wait for architect review. Until a new architect-issued handoff arrives, Z.AI must NOT:

1. start the next phase (or any later phase);
2. implement unrelated improvements;
3. make architectural decisions outside the handoff;
4. deploy unless explicitly authorized;
5. modify production (branches, database, deployment configuration);
6. silently expand scope.

This STOP boundary is mandatory for every handoff instance.

### I.10 Fresh-session usability requirements

A completely new Z.AI session with no previous conversation must be able to, from repository files alone:

1. identify its role (developer/implementer — §I.2);
2. identify the active phase (Part II Phase identity; `PROJECT_STATE.md`);
3. identify the exact scope (Part II Scope);
4. identify the non-scope (Part II Non-scope);
5. know what to read (Part II Required reading);
6. know what to implement (Part II Implementation tasks);
7. know what to test (Part II Testing requirements);
8. know what evidence to produce (Part II Evidence requirements; §I.7);
9. know when to stop (Part II STOP boundary; §I.9);
10. know that ChatGPT must review the result (Part II Review boundary; §I.8).

A handoff instance that fails any of these ten checks is defective and must be corrected before execution.

### I.11 Relationship to other control documents

Fresh-session read order for a Z.AI developer session:

1. `docs/project-control/PROJECT_STATE.md` (authoritative current state);
2. `docs/project-control/CURRENT_PHASE.md` (active-phase contract);
3. **this file** — `docs/project-control/ZAI_HANDOFF.md` (active handoff instance);
4. `docs/project-control/VERIFICATION_STATE.md` (evidence and verification state);
5. `docs/project-control/NEXT_ACTION.md` (smallest continuation instruction);
6. registers as needed: `DECISIONS.md`, `ISSUES.md`, `RISKS.md`;
7. codebase agent instructions: `Doc/18-09-2026/AGENTS.md`; immutable-source rules: `docs/doable-source/AGENTS.md`.

`ZAI_HANDOFF.phase` (Part II Phase identity) participates in the Final State Contract and must agree with `PROJECT_STATE.current_phase`, `CURRENT_PHASE.phase`, `NEXT_ACTION.phase`, `VERIFICATION_STATE.phase`, and the latest verified commit.

### I.12 Template and instance management

- `docs/project-control/templates/PHASE_HANDOFF_TEMPLATE.md` is the single canonical blank phase-handoff form (Phase 0 report §10; plan Phase 2). No other handoff template may be created; no duplicate handoff source may exist (`git ls-files` must show exactly one handoff protocol file and one phase-handoff template file under `docs/project-control/`).
- `docs/project-control/templates/CORRECTION_HANDOFF_TEMPLATE.md` is the single canonical correction-handoff form (established by Phase 6, 2026-10-01; the appendix variant in the phase template is superseded from Phase 6 onward and remains only as the historical record of the Phase 0–5 convention). Corrective-handoff instances are materialized from it into Part II of this file per §I.5.
- New instances are created by filling the template from the architect's issued handoff and replacing Part II of this file as the first implementation task of the new phase.
- Superseded instances are NOT kept as separate files (that would create competing sources of truth); they remain recoverable in Git history, and from Phase 4 onward in the canonical worklog.

## Part II — Active Handoff Instance

> **No active Z.AI implementation handoff.** Current repository state is Integrations I-2 — IMPLEMENTED / VERIFICATION PENDING. ChatGPT is the implementation owner under D-024. Z.AI is STOPPED and must not resume from any superseded Phase 7 or I-1 handoff.

## 1. Current status

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Status | **STOPPED — AWAITING ARCHITECT DIRECTION** |
| Current bounded work | Integrations I-2 verification and security correction only |
| Repository | Rilan-Dev/Clara-AI-Platform |
| Branch | feature/ai-core-from-doable-source |
| Developer | ChatGPT |
| Architect / controller | ChatGPT |
| Active Z.AI scope | **NONE** |
| Reason | D-024 implementation-owner takeover; I-2 has not received architect PASS |
| Next handoff | Only if ChatGPT explicitly delegates a new bounded task |

## 2. STOP boundary

Z.AI MUST NOT:

- implement I-3 or any later integration capability;
- add OAuth transport, MCP runtime, new egress architecture, or production deployment;
- alter billing semantics;
- modify immutable Doable/reference material;
- resume any stale handoff recovered from Git history;
- infer authorization from commits, issue text, or historical handoff records.

If Z.AI is asked to continue, it must first obtain a fresh ChatGPT-issued handoff whose baseline matches the current branch HEAD.

## 3. Current architect review status

I-2 is **not accepted**. Gate-C executable evidence is missing, Gate-E database verification is missing, and Gate-D remains open. The current architect corrections address sensitive integration tracing/error logging, tenant-scoped integration-store access, and agent/org ownership enforcement. These changes do not constitute phase closure.
